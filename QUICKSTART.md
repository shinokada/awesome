# Quick Start Guide - Awesome Enhanced v0.6.0

## Installation

### Step 1: Test Enhanced Version (Recommended)

Test the enhanced version alongside your current installation:

```bash
# Navigate to your awesome directory
cd ~/Bash/awesome

# Make the enhanced files executable
chmod +x awesome-enhanced utils/lib-enhanced

# Test the new features
./awesome-enhanced doctor
./awesome-enhanced --help
```

### Step 2: Create Configuration (Optional)

```bash
# Create config directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/awesome

# Copy example config
cp awesome.config.example ~/.config/awesome/config

# Edit if needed
nano ~/.config/awesome/config
```

### Step 3: Activate Enhanced Version

Once you're satisfied with testing:

**IMPORTANT:** Run these commands in your awesome source directory (`~/Bash/awesome`), NOT in `~/.local/share/bin/`!

```bash
# Navigate to source directory first
cd ~/Bash/awesome

# Backup originals
cp awesome awesome.v0.5.3.backup
cp utils/lib utils/lib.v0.5.3.backup

# Activate enhanced versions
mv awesome-enhanced awesome
mv utils/lib-enhanced utils/lib

# Ensure executable
chmod +x awesome utils/lib
```

**OR use the automated migration script (recommended):**
```bash
cd ~/Bash/awesome
./migrate.sh
```
